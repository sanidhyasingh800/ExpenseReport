# Finance Tracker

## Project Proposal
I plan to implement a **Finance Tracker** Application for my Personal Project.
Living off campus my second year made me realize how much money we spend on groceries, monthly bills,
transportation, and more. Having a simple application in which we can track our purchases and see basic
statistics about how we are spending our money would be extremely useful for the everyday student.

This application will be catered towards students who want a simple way of having
all purchases and expenses tracked in one place. It will provide users a method to add
different types of expenses such as recurring monthly bills and subscriptions, one time expenses,
and other categories such as food, transportation, and more. Users can see how much money they
are spending over the period of a day, week, or month, as well as what percentage of their spending
is spent in different categories. Users can also add a budget cap to track how much money they have
left over after each expense.


A Detailed View of the Functionalities:
- A way to add different types of expenses
- Label each type of expense
- Set up recurring expenses
- Track amount spent within each category
- Track percentage of money spent on each category over days, weeks, months
- Add a budget cap to a specific day, week, or month
